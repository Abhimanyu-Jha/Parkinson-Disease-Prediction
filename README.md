# Parkinson-Disease-Prediction

> Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Prediction from Speech Analysis, Machine Learning Project at Indraprastha Institue of Information Technology, Delhi

This repository contains the python code for training and testing multiple models on the [UCI ML Repository's Parkinson's Disease Classification Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Parkinson%27s+Disease+Classification). The aim of this project was to analyse the performance of different sklearn models on their ability to classify if a patient has Parkinson's Disease or not from the speech signal analysis of the patient.  


## Running Models (run_model.py)
1. Use ```python run_model.py --help``` to see the complete list of trained models. 
2. Choose a model with the `python run_model.py --model {model_number}` to use the pretrained model on the parkinsons's disease dataset.
